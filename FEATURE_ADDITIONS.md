## NEW FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT (Priority Order)

### 1. QR Code Generation (5 min to implement)
Every event and share link gets a QR code. Uses `qrcode` npm package.
- Show on event detail page
- Include in share dialog
- Downloadable as PNG
- Scannable for event check-in

```bash
npm install qrcode @types/qrcode
```

```typescript
// lib/utils/qrcode.ts
import QRCode from 'qrcode'

export async function generateQRCode(url: string): Promise<string> {
  return QRCode.toDataURL(url, {
    width: 256,
    margin: 2,
    color: { dark: '#000000', light: '#FFFFFF' },
  })
}
```

### 2. Event Templates (Save & Reuse)
Users can save any event as a template. When creating new events, choose from templates.
- "Save as Template" button on any event
- Template gallery in the new event flow
- Pre-built templates: "Weekly Standup", "Birthday Party", "Dinner Reservation", "Road Trip"

```sql
-- Add to schema
CREATE TABLE event_templates (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  event_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  template_data JSONB NOT NULL, -- All event fields except dates
  is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT false, -- Community templates
  use_count INT DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 3. Beautiful Event Landing Pages (Luma-style)
The share link page (`/share/[token]`) should be STUNNING:
- Hero section with gradient based on event type
- Large emoji + event title
- Date/time with "Add to Calendar" buttons (Google, Outlook, Apple, .ics)
- Location with embedded Google Maps preview
- Description
- RSVP button (big, prominent)
- Attendee count: "12 going · 3 maybe"
- QR code
- Footer: "Powered by EventSync"

### 4. Copy Availability as Text (From Vimcal)
One-click button that copies your free time slots as formatted text:
```
I'm available:
• Mon, Jan 20: 2:00 PM – 4:00 PM
• Tue, Jan 21: 10:00 AM – 12:00 PM
• Thu, Jan 23: 1:00 PM – 5:00 PM
```
Users paste this into Slack/email. Simple but incredibly useful.

### 5. Emoji Reactions on Events (From Amie)
Shared events can have emoji reactions from attendees:
- 🔥 Excited
- ❤️ Love it
- 😂 Fun
- 💪 Let's go
- 🤔 Thinking
Show reaction counts on event cards and detail pages.

### 6. AI Daily Briefing (From Motion/Reclaim)
A morning notification card on the dashboard:
```
☀️ Good morning, Nada! Here's your day:

📅 3 events today
⏰ First event: Team Standup at 9:00 AM (in 45 min)
⚠️ Conflict: Lunch with Sarah overlaps with Design Review
💡 Reminder: Tech Conference is in 2 days — have you packed?
🌤️ Weather: 72°F, partly cloudy — no umbrella needed
```
Generated by Claude API each morning based on user's events.

### 7. Event Packing/Prep Checklists
Auto-generated per event type, editable by user:
- ✈️ Trip: Passport, Charger, Clothes, Toiletries, Travel docs
- 💼 Business: Laptop, Notes, Business cards, Presentation
- 🎂 Birthday: Gift, Card, Party outfit
- 🏋️ Sports: Gear, Water bottle, Towel, Change of clothes
- 💒 Wedding: Gift, Outfit, Card, Directions

```sql
CREATE TABLE event_checklists (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  event_id UUID REFERENCES events(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  items JSONB DEFAULT '[]', -- [{id, text, checked, added_by: 'ai'|'user'}]
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 8. Event Map View
A page showing all events on a map (for events with locations):
- Uses Leaflet (free, no API key needed) or Google Maps embed
- Pins colored by event type
- Click pin → event preview popover
- Filter by date range, event type
- Heat map mode: show where you spend most time

```bash
npm install leaflet react-leaflet @types/leaflet
```

### 9. Speedy Events Toggle (From Google Calendar)
Setting: "Make meetings shorter"
- 30 min meetings → 25 min
- 60 min meetings → 50 min
- Gives buffer time between back-to-back events
- Toggle in user settings

### 10. Travel Time Blocks (From Apple Calendar)
When an event has a location:
- AI estimates travel time based on user's default location
- Shows a "travel" block before the event on calendar
- Color-coded differently (striped/hatched pattern)
- "Leave by 2:45 PM to arrive by 3:00 PM"

### 11. Multiple Calendar Layers (From Google Calendar)
Users can create sub-calendars:
- Personal (default)
- Work
- Team/Organization
- Imported (subscriptions)
Each has its own color. Toggle visibility on/off.

### 12. Year in Review / Event Analytics Summary
A beautiful summary page (like Spotify Wrapped):
- Total events attended
- Events by type (pie chart)
- Busiest month
- Most visited location
- Total hours in events
- Best-rated event (from reflections)
- Streak: longest consecutive days with events
- Shareable as an image card

### 13. Smart Conflict Resolution (AI-Powered)
When creating an event that overlaps:
- Show warning: "This conflicts with [Event Name]"
- AI suggests: "The dentist appointment was booked earlier and is harder to reschedule. Consider moving the team meeting."
- Option to keep both, move one, or cancel one
- Visual indicator on calendar for overlapping events

### 14. Event Cost Calculator (From Clockwise)
For business events with attendees:
- "This 2-hour meeting with 5 people ≈ 10 person-hours"
- Optional: set hourly rates → show estimated cost
- Dashboard metric: "Total meeting cost this month: $2,400"

### 15. Cultural Calendar Integration
Auto-suggest holidays based on user's preferences:
- Checkbox list: Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, Buddhist, Chinese, National holidays
- Auto-add selected holidays to calendar
- Warn when scheduling over holidays

## COMPETITION KILLER MOVES

### The "1-Minute Demo" Flow
When judges open your app, they should see magic in under 60 seconds:
1. Login → see a beautiful dashboard with demo data
2. Click calendar → Google Calendar-quality view with colorful event types
3. Create event → watch the form TRANSFORM as they pick an event type (confetti, color change, emoji)
4. Open AI chat → type "add a dinner with my team next Friday at 7pm at an Italian restaurant" → watch it auto-create
5. Click share → get a beautiful Luma-style public page + QR code
6. Open dashboard → animated charts and stats

### The "This Can't Be Real" Moments
Features that make judges think "a team built this, not one person":
1. The theme engine — pick ANY color, whole app transforms
2. Event-type animations — confetti bursts, floating clouds
3. AI image import — upload a flyer, see it parsed perfectly
4. Year in Review mockup — even if it's just the UI
5. QR codes everywhere — professional touch
6. Voice event creation — speak into the mic, event appears
7. The command palette — Cmd+K feels like a professional tool
